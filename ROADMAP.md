# Roadmap: Semantic MIDI Editing for Ardour

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for transforming Music Cursor from a chat-driven MIDI control system into a sophisticated semantic MIDI editing platform.

## Vision

Enable natural language commands like:
- **"Make the bass beat from measures 8-12 jazzier"**
